- rewrite Products in the style of Sums

- move CatOmega* to another repo

- implement MTLC with a pair of a context & a function mapping vars to modes.

- stop using ∪ and use ∨ instead

- Figure out how I'll be handling ACC. ProsetSem.Types needs this.

- Lambdas.agda: Either work on it or put it in a different repo.
  Looks like there's an aborted attempt to use it in ProsetSem.Terms.
