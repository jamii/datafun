- make a dependency graph of all modules. agda --dependency or something can do it.
  see https://github.com/Toxaris/filter-agda-dependency-graph

- avoid naming conflict: Cat.bottom, Datafun.bottom

- rewrite Products in the style of Sums
- rename bot and bot≤ to ⊥ and ⊥≤.
- stop using ∪ and use ∨ instead.
- Prosets.agda:169: revisit with copattern syntax.

- clean up ACC, it's a mess and I don't know what's used by what.
- do I use CatOmega* anywhere? I think they're just wankery.
- Lambdas. Either work on it or put it in a different repo.
