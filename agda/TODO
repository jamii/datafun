- do I need ToneSem.agda? can I integrate it into Tones.agda?

- consider how to make product & sum objects produced in the types of holes look
  more reasonable. would going back to the old Product/Sum solve this? use "git
  checkout" to see!

- fix the precedences for ∨, ∧, ≤, ⊆, ∈, etc. Not so loose, and ∨ looser than ∧.

- stop using ∪ and use ∨ instead

- Figure out how I'll be handling ACC. ProsetSem.Types needs this.
  Answer: use "classical" definition of ACC & use Markov to do the fixed point
  computation. So do I use ClassicalAcc.agda and throw away ACC.agda?

- Lambdas.agda: Either work on it or put it in a different repo.
  Looks like there's an aborted attempt to use it in ProsetSem.Terms.
