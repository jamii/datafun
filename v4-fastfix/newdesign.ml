===== KNOWN BUGS/DESIGN FLAWS =====

We inherit variable shadowing behavior from our target language (currently
Haskell).

===== GRIPES =====

This design involves passing types explicitly everywhere, which would be fine if
we weren't also computing with those types. But we are computing with them;
we're applying phi and delta to them. And this means we'll end up doing a
superlinear amount of work because we'll recompute the adjusted phi/delta types
at each node in the syntax tree. If we instead worked bidirectionally the whole
way through, I believe we could avoid this. But, this would require more
involved plumbing boilerpate.

However, I suspect the total amount of type computation will be negligible
anyway, and compilation speed isn't the point here anyway; this is just a proof
of concept.

(* Strings with a unique identifier and a derivative degree. The "derivative
   degree" makes it easy, given a variable, to make up a variable standing for
   its derivative. This is kind of a hack, but the alternatives are:

   1. Passing contexts mapping variables to their derivative variables; or
   2. weak hashtable magic; or
   3. functorizing everything over the type of symbols/variables.
